You know you have to eat your vegetables. But we get it, it's not easy.  

This machine learning alogorithm makes it easier to choose what vegetables you're likely to want to eat based on your previous likes and dislikes. The decision tree interface will take a collection of attributes and their values, use them to traverse the tree, then return the decision at the reached leaf.
